# ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Sentiment Analysis using BiLSTM (with TensorFlow Embedding)

This project implements a sentiment analysis model on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. It uses a Bidirectional LSTM with an embedding layer to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

---

## ðŸ“š Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews

- The [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)) is a widely used benchmark for sentiment classification.
- It contains **50,000 movie reviews**, split equally into **25,000 Positive** and **25,000 Negative** samples.
- Labels: `0` â†’ **Negative**, `1` â†’ **Positive**
- Reviews are **preprocessed and encoded as integers**, where each integer represents a word from a dictionary.

# Project Features


Load and preprocess IMDB data

Use TensorFlow's built-in Embedding layer

Build a Bidirectional LSTM model for sequence learning

Apply dropout regularization

Evaluate on test data and plot training history

---

# Web Application (Built with Streamlit)
We have built an interactive web application using Streamlit that allows users to:

Submit their own reviews

View sentiment prediction (Positive / Negative)

See the prediction confidence score


To Run Locally:


pip install streamlit

streamlit run app.py

# Model Architecture


## Input â†’ Embedding Layer â†’ BiLSTM (128 units) â†’ Dropout â†’ Dense â†’ Sigmoid

Embedding: Converts integer word indices to dense vectors

Bidirectional LSTM: Captures context from both directions

Dropout: Prevents overfitting

Dense: Outputs probability for binary classification


# Technologies Used

Python 

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Colab, VSCode
